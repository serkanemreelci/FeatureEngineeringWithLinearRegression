# FeatureEngineeringWithLinearRegression

It is possible to automatically select features in your data that are most useful or most relevant for the problem you are working on. This is a process called feature selection.Feature selection part is maybe the most crucial one for a machine learning project. It is standart for every project no mather what the problem is. Quality of the feature set directly effects the health of the model. Actually, machine learning is all about determining correct feature set.Especially in long term big projects, tens of people try to increase accuracy 97% to 98% just by trying different feature set configurations !

In this article, we will do some feature engineering and use linear regression as our base model.

Before dive in to the project, we have to get to know a little bit about the data. Data is taken from Turkey Super Futbol League between seasons of 2007 to 2015.It includes teams, players, age of players, nationality, market value of players and the points of each team at the end of the season. As you might have guessed, we will try to predict the points and ranks of the teams for a given season.
